914. X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards Easy

In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return true if and only if you can choose X >= 2 such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

Each group has exactly X cards.
All the cards in each group have the same integer.

## Example 1:
Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].

## Example 2:
Input: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: falseÂ´
Explanation: No possible partition.

## Example 3:
Input: deck = [1]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.

## Example 4:
Input: deck = [1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1].

## Example 5:
Input: deck = [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2].

## Constraints:
1 <= deck.length <= 10^4
0 <= deck[i] < 10^4
